# 📊 Machine Learning with Python - Module 4: Building Unsupervised Learning Models

## 📖 Overview

In **Module 4**, I explored **unsupervised learning techniques**, which allow machines to learn patterns and structures in data **without labeled outputs**. The focus was on **clustering methods** for grouping data points and **dimension reduction** techniques for simplifying high-dimensional data.

Key topics covered in this module:  
✔ **Clustering techniques** (Partition-based, Density-based, and Hierarchical).  
✔ **K-Means clustering** and methods for determining the best K.  
✔ **DBSCAN and HDBSCAN** for density-based clustering.  
✔ **Hierarchical clustering** using agglomerative and divisive approaches.  
✔ **Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, and UMAP for feature reduction.**  
✔ **How clustering, dimension reduction, and feature engineering work together.**

This module emphasizes how **clustering enhances data structure** and **dimension reduction improves computational efficiency**, making machine learning models more robust and interpretable.

## 📌 Topics Covered

## **1️⃣ Clustering: Unsupervised Grouping of Data**

**Clustering** is an **unsupervised learning technique** that identifies **natural groupings** in a dataset. It groups **similar data points** together, forming **meaningful structures** without requiring labeled data.

✔ **Finds hidden structures in unlabeled data.**  
✔ **Helps with customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.**  
✔ **Reduces data complexity and improves interpretability.**

### **📌 Clustering Methods**

### **📌 Partition-Based Clustering (K-Means)**

✔ **Divides data into K clusters based on centroids.**  
✔ **Minimizes intra-cluster variance.**  
✔ **Best for convex, equal-sized clusters.**

📌 **Limitations**  
✖ Requires pre-defining **K**.  
✖ Assumes clusters are **spherical and similar in size**.

### **📌 Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN & HDBSCAN)**

✔ **Finds clusters of arbitrary shape.**  
✔ **Detects noise and outliers.**  
✔ **No need to specify the number of clusters.**

📌 **Limitations**  
✖ Struggles with **clusters of varying density**.  
✖ **Sensitive to hyperparameter selection** (ε and MinPts).

### **📌 Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative & Divisive)**

✔ **Creates a tree-like dendrogram showing cluster relationships.**  
✔ **Agglomerative** (bottom-up) merges small clusters into larger ones.  
✔ **Divisive** (top-down) starts with all data and splits into smaller clusters.

📌 **Limitations**  
✖ **Computationally expensive** for large datasets.  
✖ **Sensitive to noise and outliers**.

## **2️⃣ K-Means Clustering: Finding the Optimal K**

✔ **Partitions data into K clusters using centroids.**  
✔ **Iterative algorithm minimizes within-cluster variance.**

📌 **Choosing the Right K Value**  
✔ **Elbow Method** → Identifies the optimal K by plotting variance reduction.  
✔ **Silhouette Score** → Evaluates how well points fit into their assigned clusters.  
✔ **Davies-Bouldin Index** → Measures cluster separation.

📌 **Distance Metrics in K-Means**  
✔ **Euclidean Distance** → Best for well-separated clusters.  
✔ **Manhattan Distance** → Works better for grid-based data.  
✔ **Cosine Distance** → Used for text and high-dimensional data.

## **3️⃣ DBSCAN & HDBSCAN: Density-Based Clustering**

✔ **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

- Uses **ε (radius)** and **MinPts (minimum points)** to find dense regions.
- **Finds arbitrarily shaped clusters**.
- **Identifies outliers** as noise.

✔ **HDBSCAN** (Hierarchical DBSCAN)

- **Adjusts density thresholds dynamically** to find stable clusters.
- **Works better with varying densities** than DBSCAN.
- **Creates hierarchical cluster structures**.

📌 **Comparison of DBSCAN vs. HDBSCAN**  
| **Feature** | **DBSCAN** | **HDBSCAN** |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Requires ε & MinPts? | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (automatically adjusts) |
| Handles Noise? | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Works for Varying Densities? | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Finds Arbitrary Shapes? | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Performance | Faster | More computationally expensive |

## **4️⃣ The Role of Dimension Reduction in Machine Learning**

✔ **Reduces the number of features while retaining meaningful information.**  
✔ **Improves computational efficiency and clustering accuracy.**  
✔ **Eliminates redundant or irrelevant features.**

### **📌 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

✔ **Linear transformation technique** that **projects data into a lower-dimensional space**.  
✔ **Finds new uncorrelated variables (principal components) ordered by variance.**  
✔ **Good for datasets where features are highly correlated.**

📌 **Limitations of PCA**  
✖ **Does not work well on nonlinearly correlated data.**  
✖ **Loses interpretability** → Transformed axes lack meaning.

---

### **📌 t-SNE vs. UMAP: Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction**

✔ **t-SNE** (T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

- **Preserves local relationships** between points.
- **Best for visualization of high-dimensional data.**

📌 **Limitations of t-SNE**  
✖ Computationally expensive.  
✖ Hyperparameter-sensitive.  
✖ Distorts global structure.

✔ **UMAP** (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)

- **Preserves both local & global structures better than t-SNE.**
- **Scales well for large datasets.**

📌 **Limitations of UMAP**  
✖ Over-clusters data.  
✖ Requires careful parameter tuning.  
✖ Less interpretable than PCA.

📌 **Comparison of PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP**  
| **Algorithm** | **Strengths** | **Limitations** |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **PCA** | Fast, works well on linear data | Fails for nonlinear patterns |
| **t-SNE** | Preserves local relationships | Computationally expensive |
| **UMAP** | Retains both local & global structure | Can over-cluster |

## **5️⃣ Clustering for Feature Selection & Engineering**

✔ **Feature selection with clustering** → Identifies redundant features, keeping only the most relevant ones.  
✔ **Enhances interpretability** → Helps create **new, meaningful features**.  
✔ **Reduces computational cost** → Removes unnecessary features, making models faster.

📌 **Clustering-Based Feature Selection Approach**  
1️⃣ Run a **clustering algorithm** on features.  
2️⃣ Identify **clusters of similar features**.  
3️⃣ Select **one representative feature** from each cluster.

🚀 **Key Takeaway:** Clustering helps **remove redundant features**, improving efficiency and accuracy.
