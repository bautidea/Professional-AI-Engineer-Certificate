### 2️⃣ Biological and Artificial Neurons

#### 🧬 Biological Neurons:

- **Soma**: Cell body where signals are integrated.
- **Dendrites**: Receive incoming signals from other neurons.
- **Axon**: Carries processed output to other neurons.
- **Synapses**: Connection points that transmit signals to the next neuron.

#### 🔄 Signal Propagation:

- Input → Dendrites → Soma → Axon → Synapse → Output to next neuron.
- Learning occurs by reinforcing the pathways that produce successful outputs.

#### 🤖 Artificial Neurons:

| Biological Component | Artificial Equivalent     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Dendrites            | Input signals / features  |
| Soma                 | Weighted sum + activation |
| Axon                 | Output of the neuron      |
| Synapse              | Connection to next neuron |

- Artificial neurons retain key properties: they receive inputs, combine them, and pass outputs to other layers.
- Networks of such neurons can be trained to approximate highly complex functions.

### 3️⃣ Neural Network Structure and Forward Propagation

#### 🧱 Network Architecture:

- **Input Layer**: Receives raw features.
- **Hidden Layers**: Perform transformations on the data.
- **Output Layer**: Generates final prediction.

#### 🔀 Core Concepts:

- **Forward Propagation**: Data flows layer by layer from input to output.
- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity into the model.
- **Backpropagation** and **Weight Optimization** are covered in later modules.

---

### 4️⃣ The Perceptron and Mathematical Formulation

- Each artificial neuron:
  - Computes a **linear combination** of inputs and weights.
  - Adds a **bias**.
  - Applies an **activation function**:
    \[
    a = f(z) = f\left(\sum x_i w_i + b\right)
    \]

#### 📌 Common Notation:

- \( x \): input
- \( w \): weight
- \( b \): bias
- \( z \): weighted input
- \( a \): neuron output

This mathematical abstraction allows for modeling complex relationships in data.

---

### 5️⃣ Activation Functions and Non-Linearity

#### 🔸 Why They're Needed:

- Without them, a neural network is just a **linear model**.
- Activation functions enable networks to model **non-linear and hierarchical relationships**.

#### 🧩 Example – Sigmoid:

\[
\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
\]

- Maps input to (0, 1).
- Used in binary classification.
- Prone to **vanishing gradients**, especially in deep networks.

_Note: Other functions like ReLU, tanh, and softmax are discussed in detail in Module 2._

---

### 6️⃣ Forward Propagation in Practice

- Forward propagation includes:
  - Input reception
  - Weighted summation
  - Bias addition
  - Activation transformation
  - Output transmission to next layer

#### 🔁 Layer-wise Flow:

| Step                 | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Receive Inputs       | From previous layer or raw data          |
| Compute Weighted Sum | Apply weights to each input              |
| Add Bias             | Adjust for threshold                     |
| Apply Activation     | Pass through non-linear function         |
| Output to Next Layer | Used as input for following layer/neuron |

Even in deep architectures, this pattern is repeated throughout the network.
