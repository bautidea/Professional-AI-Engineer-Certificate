## üß† Course Description

The course introduces the fundamentals of deep learning and artificial neural networks, along with the tools and techniques used to implement them. It starts with basic concepts such as neurons, forward propagation, and activation functions, then progresses into training techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent.

Throughout the course, Keras is used to build both simple and advanced models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), autoencoders, and transformers. While some advanced topics are introduced, they are presented in a simplified way suitable for learners starting out in deep learning.
