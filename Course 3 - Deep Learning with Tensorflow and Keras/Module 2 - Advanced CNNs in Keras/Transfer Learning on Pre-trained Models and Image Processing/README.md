# üß† Module 2: Transfer Learning and Image Processing in Keras

This section covers how to leverage **pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** in Keras for new image classification tasks, using strategies like **fixed feature extraction**, **fine-tuning**, and **image preprocessing** with TensorFlow.

## üîÑ Transfer Learning with Keras

Transfer learning allows the reuse of models trained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) for new, related tasks. This significantly reduces training time and enables high performance even with small datasets.

### ‚úÖ Key Concepts:

- **Feature Extraction**: Use pre-trained convolutional layers without updating weights.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Unfreeze upper layers of the base model to adapt to the new dataset.
- **Adaptability**: Especially useful in data-scarce domains like medical imaging or object detection.

### üß∞ Implementation Highlights:

- Load models like **VGG16** with `include_top=False`
- Freeze base layers to retain learned features
- Add custom Dense layers for classification
- Compile with `adam`, `binary_crossentropy`, and track `accuracy`
- Use `ImageDataGenerator` to load and preprocess training images
- Train for a fixed number of epochs (e.g., 10)

## üéØ Fixed Feature Extraction

Use pre-trained models **without updating the base weights**, ideal when:

- You have limited data or compute resources
- The new dataset is similar to the original (e.g., natural images)

### Benefits:

- Minimal training required
- Reuse of hierarchical visual features
- Efficient and scalable for real-world applications

## üîß Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Models

After training the top classifier, **selectively unfreeze** upper layers of the base model for fine-tuning.

### Best Practices:

- Unfreeze a small subset (e.g., top 4 layers)
- Use a lower learning rate to avoid catastrophic forgetting
- Always recompile the model after changing layer trainability
- Compare performance before and after fine-tuning

Fine-tuning is essential when the target dataset **differs significantly** from the original dataset.

## üñºÔ∏è TensorFlow for Image Processing

TensorFlow provides a high-level API for handling core image preprocessing tasks before training or inference.

### Supported Tasks:

- Image loading and resizing
- Normalization and batch dimension handling
- Data augmentation during training

### Common Augmentations:

- Rotation, translation, shear, zoom
- Horizontal flipping
- Real-time augmentation using generators

## üì¶ Recommended Workflow

```text
1. Load pre-trained base model (e.g., VGG16)
2. Freeze all layers initially
3. Add custom top layers (Flatten + Dense)
4. Compile and train the model
5. Unfreeze top base layers for fine-tuning
6. Re-compile and train again (with low LR)
7. Evaluate performance gains
```

## üß™ Tips for Effective Transfer Learning

- Choose pre-trained models aligned with your task (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, InceptionV3)
- Start with all layers frozen, then fine-tune progressively
- Use data augmentation to improve generalization
- Apply domain adaptation if your dataset differs significantly from ImageNet
- Always recompile when layer trainability changes
