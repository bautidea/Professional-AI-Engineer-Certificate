### üì∏ Vision Transformers (ViTs)

Transformers have been successfully adapted for image classification through Vision Transformers (ViTs). Instead of using convolutional layers, ViTs treat image patches as tokens in a sequence, similar to words in a sentence.

**Key Concepts:**

- Images are divided into fixed-size patches and flattened.
- Each patch is embedded and combined with positional encoding.
- Embedded patches are passed through a stack of transformer blocks.
- Multi-head self-attention captures spatial dependencies between patches.
- Final representations are used for classification.

**Implementation Highlights:**

- `PatchEmbedding` layer projects image patches into vector space.
- `TransformerBlock` applies self-attention and feed-forward transformations.
- `VisionTransformer` stacks multiple transformer blocks and outputs class predictions.

This approach allows ViTs to outperform many CNN-based models on image classification benchmarks by leveraging global context early in the architecture.

### üîä Speech Transformers

Speech data is sequential and typically represented as **spectrograms** (visual representations of frequency over time). Speech Transformers operate on these sequences by combining convolutional front-ends with transformer blocks.

**Key Concepts:**

- Audio is first converted into spectrograms.
- Spectrogram frames are projected via patch-like embeddings.
- Convolutional layers extract local audio features.
- Transformer layers model long-term dependencies in speech.

**Components Defined:**

- `SpeechTransformer`: full model that integrates convolutional and transformer layers.
- `TransformerBlock`: applies self-attention and feed-forward layers with residual connections.
- `call()` method processes input in batches and frames for scalability.

This structure supports efficient learning in speech-to-text applications and underlies architectures like Wav2Vec and SpeechTransformer.

### üéÆ Decision Transformers (Reinforcement Learning)

Decision Transformers adapt the transformer architecture for **trajectory modeling** in reinforcement learning. Rather than estimating value functions, these models predict the next action based on past sequences of states, actions, and rewards.

**Key Concepts:**

- Sequences of returns, states, and actions are embedded and processed as a single sequence.
- Transformers model temporal dependencies across the full trajectory.
- Output tokens are used to predict the next action.

**Key Steps:**

1. Embed the sequence of past states, actions, and returns.
2. Use transformer blocks to model dependencies across time steps.
3. Output the predicted action based on full trajectory context.

**Implementation Components:**

- `TransformerBlock`: handles attention and feed-forward operations with normalization.
- `DecisionTransformer`: defines the full model with trajectory embeddings and transformer layers.
- `call()` method generates action predictions based on context.

This approach has proven effective in complex environments by learning policies directly from sequence data.

### üìà Transformers for Time Series Forecasting

Transformers are increasingly used for **time series prediction** due to their ability to capture long-term temporal patterns, outperforming traditional RNN-based models like LSTMs and GRUs.

**Key Concepts:**

- Self-attention enables long-range dependency modeling.
- Full-sequence processing supports parallelism and faster training.
- Flexibility allows handling missing values and variable-length inputs.

**Pipeline Overview:**

1. Load and normalize time series data (e.g., stock prices).
2. Convert data into fixed-length sequences and next-step labels.
3. Embed input sequences.
4. Apply multiple transformer blocks.
5. Use a final dense layer to predict the next value.
6. Compile and train the model using Adam optimizer and MSE loss.
7. Visualize predictions against true values.

This pipeline demonstrates how transformers can be applied to structured numerical data with minimal architecture adjustments.

### üîÅ TensorFlow for Sequential Data

TensorFlow provides robust support for building models that process sequences, whether those sequences come from text, time series, or audio.

**Core Capabilities:**

- Predefined layers: `SimpleRNN`, `LSTM`, `GRU`, `Conv1D`
- Utilities for preparing text data: `TextVectorization`
- Native support for sequence padding, batching, and masking

**Covered Use Cases:**

#### Time Series (Sine Wave Demo):

- Generated synthetic sine wave data.
- Built and trained models using both `SimpleRNN` and `LSTM` layers.
- Compared prediction outputs with true values.

#### Text Processing:

- Defined text samples.
- Applied `TextVectorization` for tokenization and padding.
- Converted text into numerical format for model consumption.

These examples illustrate how TensorFlow‚Äôs high-level APIs support a wide range of sequential data workflows, from structured numeric forecasting to unstructured text preprocessing.
