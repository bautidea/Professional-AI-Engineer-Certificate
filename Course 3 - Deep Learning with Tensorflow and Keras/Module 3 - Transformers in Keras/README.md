# ü§ñ Module 3 ‚Äì Transformers in Keras

This module focuses on transformer models and their application to sequential data. It begins with the core architecture of transformers‚Äîdesigned for tasks like natural language processing‚Äîand expands into advanced applications such as computer vision, speech recognition, reinforcement learning, and time series forecasting. It also covers how TensorFlow supports the development of models for handling structured and unstructured sequential data.

## üî∑ Topics Covered

### üî∏ What Are Transformers?

Transformers are deep learning models designed to process sequences in parallel using a mechanism called **self-attention**. This mechanism enables the model to relate all parts of a sequence at once, making transformers highly efficient for capturing long-range dependencies in data.

Transformers are foundational to modern models such as:

- **BERT** for language understanding
- **GPT** for language generation
- **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for image classification

---

### üî∏ Core Components of Transformer Models

- **Self-Attention Mechanism**  
  Each token attends to all other tokens using dot-product attention over **Query**, **Key**, and **Value** vectors.

- **Positional Encoding**  
  Adds position awareness to input sequences so the model understands token order.

- **Encoder**  
  Processes input sequences using self-attention and feed-forward layers with residual connections and normalization.

- **Decoder**  
  Generates output sequences using self-attention, cross-attention (with encoder output), and feed-forward layers.

- **Multi-Head Attention**  
  Enables the model to attend to multiple representation subspaces in parallel.

- **Transformer Block and Layer**  
  Combines attention, normalization, and feed-forward layers into reusable blocks for model construction.

### üì∏ Vision Transformers (ViTs)

- Split images into patches and process them as token sequences.
- Embedded patches are passed through transformer blocks for image classification.
- Components include `PatchEmbedding`, `TransformerBlock`, and `VisionTransformer`.

### üîä Speech Transformers

- Converted audio into spectrograms and processed them as sequential data.
- Combined convolutional layers (local pattern extraction) with transformer blocks (long-term modeling).
- Implemented `SpeechTransformer` to handle speech-to-text tasks efficiently.

### üéÆ Decision Transformers (Reinforcement Learning)

- Modeled sequences of returns, states, and actions to predict future actions.
- Used transformer blocks to capture dependencies across time.
- Implemented `DecisionTransformer` for policy learning directly from trajectories.

---

### üìà Time Series Forecasting with Transformers

- Built a transformer model for predicting future values in time series data (e.g., stock prices).
- Used embedding layers, stacked transformer blocks, and a final dense layer.
- Compiled models with Adam optimizer and MSE loss for numerical forecasting.
- Visualized predictions against true values for evaluation.

### üîÅ TensorFlow Tools for Sequential Data

TensorFlow provides high-level support for modeling various types of sequential data:

#### Time Series

- Used `SimpleRNN` and `LSTM` layers on synthetic sine wave data.
- Compared RNN vs. LSTM predictions to evaluate long-term learning.

#### Text Data

- Applied `TextVectorization` for tokenization and padding.
- Converted raw text to numerical format for model training.

These examples highlight TensorFlow‚Äôs versatility for structured (time series) and unstructured (text/audio) sequences.
