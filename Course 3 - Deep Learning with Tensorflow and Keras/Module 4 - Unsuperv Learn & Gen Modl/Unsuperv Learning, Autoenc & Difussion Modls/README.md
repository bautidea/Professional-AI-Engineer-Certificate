## 🔍 Unsupervised Learning in Keras

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning approach where the model identifies patterns and relationships in data without access to labeled outputs. Its goal is to understand data structure and extract useful insights without supervision.

### 🧩 Categories of Unsupervised Learning

1. **Clustering**: Groups similar data points together.

   - Techniques: _K-Means_, _Hierarchical Clustering_

2. **Association**: Finds correlations and co-occurrence patterns.

   - Techniques: _Apriori Algorithm_, _Eclat Algorithm_

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces data complexity by minimizing features while retaining structure.
   - Techniques: _Principal Component Analysis (PCA)_, _t-SNE_

## 🧬 Autoencoders

Autoencoders are neural networks designed to compress input data into a latent representation and reconstruct it, enabling tasks like data denoising and dimensionality reduction.

### 🔧 Architecture Components

- **Encoder**: Compresses input into a lower-dimensional latent space.
- **Bottleneck**: Captures the most relevant features.
- **Decoder**: Reconstructs the input from the latent space.

### 🔨 Implementation in Keras

- Use MNIST dataset (28×28 images → flattened to 784 inputs).
- Encoder compresses from 784 → 64 → 32 dimensions.
- Decoder reconstructs from 32 → 784 dimensions.
- Train using the same data for both input and target.
- Optimizer: `Adam`, Loss: `BinaryCrossentropy`.

### 🧪 Fine-Tuning

- Unfreeze the final layers of the trained model.
- Recompile and retrain for a few epochs.
- Enhances performance and adaptability to new data.

### 🧠 Types of Autoencoders

- **Basic**: One hidden layer in encoder and decoder.
- **Variational (VAE)**: Probabilistic, used for generative tasks.
- **Convolutional**: Uses CNNs, suitable for image data.

## 🌫️ Diffusion Models

Diffusion models are generative neural networks that transform noise into structured outputs by learning to reverse a degradation process.

### 🧠 Concept and Operation

Diffusion models work in two phases:

1. **Forward Process**: Adds noise over time to structured input, converting it into random noise. Mimics natural diffusion.
2. **Reverse Process**: Trains the model to denoise data step-by-step, reconstructing the original sample from noise.

This process enables generation of high-quality data from pure noise.

### 🧰 Applications

- **Image Generation**: Produce realistic samples.
- **Image Denoising**: Restore clarity in corrupted images.
- **Data Augmentation**: Create new examples from learned distribution.

### 🏗️ Implementation with Keras

1. **Model Definition**:

   - CNN-based architecture with convolutional and dense layers.
   - Input: 28×28 noisy image → Output: denoised image.

2. **Data Preparation**:

   - Load MNIST, normalize pixel values.
   - Add random noise to simulate the forward process.
   - Input: Noisy images | Target: Clean images.

3. **Training**:

   - Trained to learn the reverse denoising process.
   - Loss: Binary cross-entropy.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Visual comparison of original, noisy, and denoised images.
   - Demonstrates the model’s capacity to restore structure.

### 🧪 Fine-Tuning

- Unfreeze final layers.
- Recompile and continue training.
- Improves denoising performance and generalization.
