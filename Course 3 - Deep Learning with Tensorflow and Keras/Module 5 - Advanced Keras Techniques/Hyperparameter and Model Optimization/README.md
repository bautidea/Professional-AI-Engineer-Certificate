# ⚙️ Module 5 – Section 2: Hyperparameter and Model Optimization

This section focuses on improving the performance, efficiency, and scalability of deep learning models through structured hyperparameter tuning and multiple optimization techniques.

It introduces Keras Tuner for automating model tuning and explores how TensorFlow tools enhance training and deployment through mixed precision, knowledge distillation, and post-training methods.

## 🧠 Hyperparameter Tuning with Keras Tuner

Keras Tuner offers an intuitive interface to optimize model performance by automatically searching for the best hyperparameter configurations.

### 🔧 Key Concepts:

- **Hyperparameters**: Pre-training values like learning rate, batch size, and layer size that shape the learning process.
- **Search Strategies**: Includes Random Search, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization.
- **Model Building**: Models are defined dynamically with parameters like `hp.Int()` and `hp.Float()` to test different configurations.
- **Search Process**: The tuner evaluates multiple model versions and selects the one that performs best on validation data.
- **Final Model Training**: After tuning, the selected model is retrained with optimal values for generalization on unseen data.

## 🚀 Model Optimization Techniques

Improving a model isn’t just about accuracy—it’s also about training speed, memory use, and deployment readiness. This section covers several strategies:

### ⚖️ Weight Initialization

- **He Initialization** (for ReLU): Prevents vanishing/exploding gradients by scaling weights based on input units.
- **Xavier Initialization** (for tanh/sigmoid): Balances variance across layers to help gradients flow consistently.

### 📉 Learning Rate Scheduling

- Dynamically adjusts learning rate during training.
- Allows high learning in early epochs and refinement in later stages.
- Example: Constant rate for 10 epochs, then exponential decay.

### 🧰 Additional Optimization Tools (TF MOT)

- **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes activations to accelerate training and improve convergence.
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Uses both float16 and float32 to speed up training and reduce memory usage.
- **Model Pruning**: Removes unnecessary weights or neurons, reducing model size without hurting accuracy.
- **Quantization**: Lowers precision of weights (e.g., to int8), useful for edge deployment.

## ⚙️ TensorFlow-Specific Optimization Techniques

TensorFlow offers integrated support for advanced optimization pipelines, especially valuable in production environments.

### 🔀 Mixed Precision Training

- Combines 16-bit and 32-bit precision automatically.
- Reduces memory bandwidth and accelerates training without losing accuracy.
- Enabled via setting global compute policy to `"mixed_float16"`.

### 🧪 Knowledge Distillation

- Trains a lightweight model (“student”) to mimic a large, high-accuracy model (“teacher”).
- Uses softened softmax logits and distillation loss to transfer knowledge.
- Ideal for deploying efficient models without sacrificing performance.
