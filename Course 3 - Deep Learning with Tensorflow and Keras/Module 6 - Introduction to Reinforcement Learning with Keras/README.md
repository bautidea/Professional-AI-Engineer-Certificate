## üîÅ Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals

Reinforcement learning is a decision-making paradigm where agents learn optimal behavior through trial and error by interacting with an environment.

- **Agent**: The decision-maker (e.g., a game player or an ad placement engine).
- **Environment**: The space where the agent operates (e.g., a game board or a webpage).
- **Actions**: Decisions taken by the agent to alter the environment.
- **Rewards**: Feedback signals that guide the agent's learning, typically delayed and uncertain.

Agents learn by continuously adjusting their actions to maximize cumulative future rewards. This loop creates a dynamic learning process, where every decision affects the next state of the environment.

## üß© Real-World Applications of RL

Reinforcement learning has powered breakthroughs like:

- **DeepMind‚Äôs Atari system (2013)** ‚Äì AI that outperformed humans in classic video games.
- **AlphaGo (2017)** ‚Äì First system to defeat a Go world champion.

It‚Äôs also gaining traction in business areas like:

- **Recommendation systems** (rewards tied to prediction accuracy)
- **Marketing optimization** (clicks or revenue as feedback)
- **Automated bidding** (reward-driven budget efficiency)

## üßÆ Q-Learning with Keras

Q-learning is a foundational algorithm in RL that teaches agents to make decisions by estimating action values.

- **Q-values (Q(s, a))**: Estimate of expected rewards from taking action `a` in state `s`.
- **Bellman Equation**: Iteratively updates Q-values based on immediate and future rewards.
- **Q-table**: Stores all state-action values ‚Äî practical only for small environments.
- **Q-network**: Neural network alternative for large/continuous state spaces.

üõ† **Implementation Highlights**:

- Use of `OpenAI Gym` for the CartPole environment.
- Keras model approximates the Q-function with dense layers.
- Training with an Œµ-greedy policy (balancing exploration/exploitation).
- Evaluation involves tracking rewards and rendering performance across episodes.

## üß† Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) with Keras

DQNs extend Q-learning by using deep learning to handle complex environments more efficiently.

### üí° Core Concepts

- **Q-value Function Approximation**: A neural network replaces the Q-table and generalizes across states.
- **Experience Replay**: Past experiences `(state, action, reward, next_state)` are stored and sampled randomly to stabilize learning.
- **Target Network**: A secondary network generates stable Q-value targets and is updated less frequently than the primary network.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Steps

- **Environment & Parameters**: Initialize CartPole environment, set learning rate, discount factor, exploration rate, and replay buffer size.
- **Q-Networks**: Build primary and target networks with identical architectures.
- **Replay Buffer**: Store experiences using a double-ended queue (deque) for sampling during training.
- **Training Loop**:
  - Select actions with Œµ-greedy policy.
  - Store experiences with `remember()`.
  - Sample minibatches and apply the Bellman equation in `replay()`.
  - Decay Œµ to shift from exploration to exploitation.
  - Sync target network weights periodically.
- **Evaluation**: Run the trained agent without randomness and log total rewards to assess performance.

## üß© Key Concepts

- RL trains agents to maximize long-term rewards through interaction with uncertain environments.
- Q-learning is value-based and off-policy, driven by the Bellman equation.
- For large state spaces, Q-networks replace Q-tables, enabling function approximation via Keras.
- DQNs add experience replay and target networks to stabilize training in complex environments.
