# üìö Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras

Welcome to the course **Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras**, part of the **AI Engineer Professional Certificate by IBM**.

In this course, I explored advanced deep learning techniques using the powerful combination of **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. The course focuses on mastering model customization, handling complex data types (like images and sequences), and building state-of-the-art architectures for classification, generation, and reinforcement learning.

All modules include practical labs that allowed me to experiment with the tools and techniques in realistic scenarios, using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
