# üß† Introduction to Neural Networks with PyTorch

This repository documents my progress through the **"Introduction to Neural Networks with PyTorch"** course, part of the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate**.

PyTorch is one of the most in-demand technologies in AI development. It is widely used to design, train, and optimize neural networks in domains such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. This course provides a practical introduction to core neural network concepts using PyTorch, reinforced by hands-on labs and a final project.
